Thu 15 Sep 2011 07:35:13 PM CEST

=== To release as 2.6 ===


Thu 15 Sep 2011 06:20:16 PM CEST

MultiLink Redirect

* Added re-direction for cached pages. Currently defaults to enabled (unless page caching is disabled.)  It can be disabled in settings.php with:
$conf['multilink_redirect_cached_pages'] = FALSE;

When enabled, anonymous access to node/123 would be redirected to fr/node/124 where 124 is the French version of 123 and preferred language from browser is French. If a path for node/124 exists the visitor will be redirected there. This would previously only happen for non-cached pages.  Redirection in this way is probably better for SEO and user-experience, but has a small performance impact (only significant when serving cached pages.)

* Fixed unreported bug which could result in invalid entires in the module's cache table. The effect of the bug was that trying to go to node/123 where there 123 does not exist would result in being redirected to the front-page.

* Other small fixes to front-page handling.

MultiLink

* Added support for the above changes in ML Redirect.

* Added drupal_goto to redirect to plain url without &multilink=switch after deliberate language switch.

* Other minor changes.


Tue 13 Sep 2011 11:25:07 PM CEST

MultiLink

* Addressed behaviour when user is anonymous and page-caching is enabled. Forces current language to be used instead of user preference - this prevents cached pages from containing links generated based on user (browser) preferred language.

* Added Pathologic to supported formats.

* Other minor tweaks.

Mon 12 Sep 2011 06:19:03 PM CEST

MultiLink

* Added detection of deliberate language switching by user. This works with the standard Drupal language switcher block, and any other methods which generated links in such a way that HOOK_translation_link_alter will be called.  Also works with the standard links to translations typically shown on node pages, and any other links which have class='translation-link' set.  Adds ?multilink=switch to those links, which is then checked via hook_init.

* Added additional highest language preference, saved in session, and set when a deliberate language switch is detected (see above.)  So, after a language switch is performed, the new language is then used as the first preferred language for ML link generation.

* Added possibility for setting order of preference in settings.php using 'multilink_language_order' e.g:
$conf['multilink_language_order'] = array('current','selected','preferred','default');
If not defined, default is: 'selected','preferred','current','default'.

* Fixed bug fix in processing of HTML anchor tags (small change to regexp.)

MultiLink Redirect

* Changed so that no redirect is performed when deliberate language switch is detected (see above.)

=== To release as 2.5. ===

Thu 16 Sep 2010 14:40:05 CEST

MultiLink Redirect
* Added 'bypass multilink redirect' permission to prevent redirect for admin and any other assigned roles (for testing or translation team.)

MultiLink Redirect
* Added hooks to modifiy translation links and add 'bypass option so that manually selecting translation will now work as expected. Tested with language switcher block, language switcher dropdown, and standard node-view translation links.

Fri 10 Sep 2010 20:54:54 CEST

MultiLink
* Bug fix to multilink_url - preferred language was not set properly, so urls would not use it.

MultiLink Secure Pages
* Minor fix to function definition to prevent PHP warnings about pass-by-reference.

To release as 2.4


Fri 10 Sep 2010 18:30:32 CEST

MultiLink:

* Changed to use user's language preference when generating url, see [#796822]

Tue 11 May 2010 15:04:16 CEST

Mon 12 Apr 2010 18:01:54 CEST

* Fixed #769076 - Bug in InsertNode regexp.
* Added support for LinoDef and Link-node formats.
